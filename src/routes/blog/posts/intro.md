I guess I'm making a blog. Maybe more kind of a journal. I'm not good at this kind of thing though, so I don't know if they'll be useful, or even consistent.

I've had a hard time getting motivated recently, after finishing boot camp. It as a great time, but honestly too short, and I don't feel like I've learned as much as I was hoping. The information learned was good, but it didn't feel like there was a lot of practical use.

Hopefully this blog gets me motivated to actually think about what I'm doing and learning, and motivates me to try other things.
