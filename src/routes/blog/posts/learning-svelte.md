title: Learning Svelte

tags: ["musings", "learning", "programming", "svelte", "js"]
summary: "This site, and my bgtools app, are both made using Sveltekit.\n\n

Like I said in my first post (yesterday), after bootcamp I wasn't really sure what to do. I applied to 100 jobs in a few weeks, with most giving me autogenerated rejections. I'll probably try to write more about it later, if I remember and want to.\n\n

I explored around a bit during that time, trying to decide what I wanted to dedicate myself to. I had learned React at bootcamp (and used it during my internship), but I didn't really like it. There's something about how components and state work that's really finnicky, even if the end result is great.\n\n

I looked into Next.js, and I liked it more than React, but due to various reasons I fell off the train (like I did with Rust). I think I have a problem with starting/doing tutorials, and not actually learning things. I kinda figured this was the case before, because I had tried to learn programming many times before deciding to attend boot camp.\n\n

Svelte is really cool. It reminds me a lot of using plain HTML and Javascript. There's no state management, and props look more like normal variables, which I like. Pages look like HTML, components look like HTML (which makes sense, because they're DOM elements), and you just import Javascript/Typescript like usual. I generally like simple things that have complexity (I prefer CoD1 and Unreal to current FPS games), so coming from React, it feels like Rock Lee vs. Gaara.\n\n

I've tried incorporating a little Typescript, but I'm already struggling with the programming just in general, because it takes a long time for me to get things working. It's frustrating, but there are points where I feel myself remembering (generally) how I did something before, and that progress feels good.\n\n

I also learned about click, pointer, and touch events. I didn't learn too much, mostly just how to listen to them, and how to parse and use some data, like location. Once bgtools is more up to date, I'll look into doing Typescript properly, and making sure my events and handlers are done right. I'll probably do styling, too, because of hover, touchup, touchdown, etc.\n\n

Hopefully POE league doesn't kick my motivation."
